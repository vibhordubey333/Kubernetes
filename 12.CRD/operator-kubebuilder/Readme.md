It looks like the kubebuilder package has been moved to a different location. The error message indicates that the sigs.k8s.io/kubebuilder module does not contain the cmd/kubebuilder package.

After some research, I found that the kubebuilder binary is now available in the sigs.k8s.io/controller-tools/cmd/controller-gen package.

To install Kubebuilder, you can try the following command:

bash
CopyInsert in Terminal
go install sigs.k8s.io/controller-tools/cmd/controller-gen@latest
However, this will install the controller-gen binary, not kubebuilder. It seems that Kubebuilder is no longer available as a separate binary.

Instead, you can use the kubebuilder tools as a part of the controller-tools package. You can use the following command to generate the scaffolding for a new Kubernetes API:

bash
CopyInsert in Terminal
controller-gen scaffold --domain example.com --repo example.com/project
This will generate the necessary files for a new Kubernetes API.

If you're looking for a specific version of Kubebuilder, you can try checking out the Kubebuilder releases page and downloading the binary manually.

I apologize for any confusion caused by the outdated installation instructions.
